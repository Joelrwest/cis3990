Technology: I've taught myself how to use the DALL E 2 API, and I hadn't planned on it but in order to do it I had to teach myself how to set up a server in node js.

Rationale: As part of our project (fitting room) we need to be able to change the clothes of the avatar. DALL E seems like a tool that could help with that massively since we can put any clothes on it relatively easily.

Tutorial: I didn't use a tutorial, but I did use a tonne of stackoverflow articles that I can link if you guys want (there's probably like 50 though...). The thing that helped the most was the OpenAI API.
